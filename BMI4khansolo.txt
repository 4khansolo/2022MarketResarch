For example, if the price dips lower than 50 Moving Averages (MA), it will highlight as a white color. If the close (closed price) is lower than the 200 MA, then the highlight color turns into orange. Finally, if the close value (closing price) dips lower than the 20% of the recent highs, it will highlight purple.
